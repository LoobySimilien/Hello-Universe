# Hello-Universe


My "Get to Know Me" Site:

I created this intro webpage through a Women Who Code NYC workshop.

Just a simple site, while having fun and networking with other dynamic women in tech.

HTML5 and CSS3.

Paste the below URL into your browser to view the work...

If you want to see "my pride and joy" project, go to my Coding-Calendar repo... to my gh-pages branch rendering (http://LoobySimilien.github.io/Coding-Calendar/) and view this project, featuring HTML, CSS and a bit of JQuery.

Make sure you visit the gh-pages branch of my other repos to see my other creations.
